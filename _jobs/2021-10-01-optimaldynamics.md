# Engineering Team Lead

*Remote or NYC*

<br/>

As an Engineering Team Lead, you will manage a team of engineers, own significant chunks of our architecture, design and build systems at scale, and shape product decisions. You'll work on challenging projects, make an impact, and grow as an engineer and a leader.

You will iterate on our agile process to help us build better software as a cohesive team. You will collaborate with our analytics and product teams to define the scope of projects, and plan deliverables. And you will have the opportunity to develop your non-technical skills by mentoring engineers on your team, leading projects your team is responsible for, and helping influence our technical direction.

We use these technologies: Python, Django, Docker, RESTful APIs, and Kafka for microservices implementations. We use Git/Github for source control, Terraform for infrastructure as code, and AWS services for cloud infrastructure.

We are looking for someone with experience on building applications for 5+ years and know the systems theyâ€™ve worked on from top to bottom. The person should have experience running a team in an Agile environment as well as designing and developing microservices and  large scale distributed systems.

Our benefits package is very comprehensive:
Equity for all employees
Health / Dental / Vision 100% covered for employee and 50% for dependents
Life Insurance
401(k) match
Unlimited PTO (vacation, personal days, sick days, jury duty, military leave, bereavement)
11 Holidays
Paid Parental Leave for all employees
Fitness Membership reimbursement
Commuter benefit
Flexible work from home policy
