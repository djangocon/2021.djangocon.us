# Backend Software Engineer

*US - Remote*

*$90k - $120k*

Healthvana makes navigating our health better by empowering the patient with their own health information. We created a patient platform for healthcare providers to manage and communicate with their populations. Healthvana excels at engaging patients in their health and helping them take whatever next step towards better health - all via your mobile phone.
Since 2015, our technology has been used in the fight to help end HIV, and since April 2020, to end COVID-19. Healthvana is the nation’s leading patient platform for both HIV and COVID-19 - having helped tens-of-millions of patients achieve better health outcomes.

Healthvana is looking to add a Backend Engineer to our growing team. Solid, readable, well-tested code is more important to us than the quickest thing you can deploy to production (though we like to move fast, too). We use well-known technologies like Python, Django, and React.

*Requirements*
- Have experience building and running production web applications (2+ years)
- Experience writing Python, preferably 3.6 or newer
- Some experience with Django
- Are able to communicate clearly and compassionately via Slack and video meetings with coworkers with diverse backgrounds and varying levels of experience
- Enjoy mentoring colleagues whose specialties and experience differ from yours
- Believe in shipping code early and often
- Are willing and legally able to work in the United States
- Are able to work weekdays during our core business hours of 9am - 3pm Pacific

*Bonus Points*
- Some experience with Django Rest Framework or similar frameworks
- Experience working with EMRs, PHI, and HIPAA-compliant systems
- You've worked with Javascript and React
- A solid understanding of automated testing and belief that a feature is not complete until tests are written
- You’ve got experience in healthcare, and you understand the industry’s challenges for both patients and providers, and where those challenges intersect (and where they don’t)
