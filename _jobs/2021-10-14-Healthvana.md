**Senior Back-End / Python Engineer**

*US - Remote*

*$110k - $150k*

Healthvana makes navigating our health better by empowering the patient with their own health information. We created a patient platform for healthcare providers to manage and communicate with their populations. Healthvana excels at engaging patients in their health and helping them take whatever next step towards better health - all via your mobile phone.
Since 2015, our technology has been used in the fight to help end HIV, and since April 2020, to end COVID-19. Healthvana is the nation’s leading patient platform for both HIV and COVID-19 - having helped tens-of-millions of patients achieve better health outcomes.

Healthvana is looking to add a Senior Backend Engineer to our growing team. Solid, readable, well-tested code is more important to us than the quickest thing you can deploy to production (though we like to move fast, too). We use well-known technologies like Python, Django, and React.

*Requirements*
- Have solid experience building and running production web applications (5+ years)
- Strong working experience with Python 3.6 or greater
- At least 2 years of experience working with Django or similar frameworks
- Django Rest Framework experience or similar frameworks to build APIs
- A solid understanding of automated testing and belief that a feature is not complete until tests are written
- Are able to communicate clearly and compassionately via Slack and video meetings with coworkers with diverse backgrounds and varying levels of experience
- Enjoy mentoring colleagues whose specialties and experience differ from yours
- Believe in shipping code early and often
- Are willing and legally able to work in the United States
- Are able to work weekdays during our core business hours of 9am - 3pm Pacific

*Bonus Points*
- Experience working with EMRs, PHI, and HIPAA-compliant systems
- Comfortable acting as a technical lead
- Experience with Javascript and React
- Profiling and optimization of APIs, database queries, and other services
