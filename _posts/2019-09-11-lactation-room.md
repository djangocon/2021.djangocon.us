This year, DjangoCon US is dedicating a room to nursing parents who need to pump breast milk during the conference. This room will be available on the tutorial and talk days, Sunday - Wednesday.

**Hours**:

- Sunday: 8:00 a.m. - 5:30 p.m.
- Monday-Wednesday 8:00 a.m. - 6:30 p.m.

**Location**: Santa Fe 3

You may sign up for pumping times in one-hour blocks on a sign-up sheet that will be posted on the lactation room door. The entrance to the lactation room will be draped from the outside to protect the privacy of the people inside.

The lactation room will contain:

- A small fridge to store pumped milk
- Supplies to label your pumped milk
- Antibacterial wipes

The lactation room will not contain a sink, but a bathroom is not far. Unfortunately, we are not able to stream the audio or video for the talks into this room.

Please be sure to collect pumped milk by 5:30 p.m. on Sunday or 6:30 p.m. Monday - Wednesday. Pumped milk not collected by 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Sept. 25, will be thrown out because the hotel will be removing the fridge and breaking down the room.

If there's anything else we can do to support your needs at DjangoCon US, let us know by emailing <a href="mailto:hello@djangocon.us">hello@djangocon.us</a>!
