  Kolo shows you everything happening in your running Django app, right inside VSCode. Kolo is built with the belief that when it's really easy to see what's going on under the hood, it's much easier to fix problems, add new functionality, and build a strong mental model of your codebase. Use Kolo to inspect, observe, and visualize what's really going on under the hood – live, while it's happening. Explore every single executed codepath, local variables, SQL queries, and outbound HTTP requests – all in real-time. Spend less time gathering context, and more time writing code.
